<p> During the past few months New Yorkers have been struggling with their mental health more than ever. “New Yorkers, and particularly communities of color, are facing unprecedented challenges that are understandably affecting their emotional and mental health,” Dr. Hillary Kunnis, the Executive Deputy Commissioner of the Health Department said in a press release published September 22, 2020. Since mental health was an issue pre-COVID the resources needed to help navigate this treacherous time already existed. Mental health services for City Employees, and homeless youth shelters increased during the beginning stages of COVID. Additionally, resources like NYC Well, a texting, calling, and messaging therapy service, also skyrocketed by the thousands. Through this data we can see that anxiety and depression have also increased as a result of isolation during the pandemic.  </p>
